# Hey, I'm Tom Osman 👋

Mallorca-based technologist, educator, "vibe-coder" and builder running [Shiny Technologies](https://heyshiny.com) while filming edcuational tutorials for the AI frontier. I live at [tomosman.com](https://tomosman.com) where I broadcast every experiment in public.

> Discovering what's possible with technology and handing those capabilities to everyone.

## Operating Modes

- **Technology Dealer** – curate the tools that bend reality and show how to wield them.  
- **Educator in Residence** – live-build AI agents, film walkthroughs, and ship reuse-ready docs.  
- **Builder / Consultant** – architect workflows and revenue-grade systems for ambitious AI teams.  
- **Video-First Communicator** – explain complex topics with multi-angle capture, live labs, and 4K tutorials.

## What I'm Doing in 2025

- **Founder, Shiny (Mar 2021 – Now)** – boutique consultancy finding the edge of digital tech and helping partners take advantage.  
- **Education & Growth, Synthflow AI (Jul 2024 – Mar 2025)** – built Synthflow Academy, shipped training for 20k+ operators, and design AI voice assistant programs.  
- **AI Scout, Interface Capital (Dec 2023 – Now)** – evaluate iconic AI startups, meet founders, and route investments.  
- **Head of Education, Makerpad (2019 – 2021)** – led the no-code education team that trained thousands of builders.  
- Earlier: Product Manager at Teachers Register, Northcoders bootcamp grad, digital recruiter at Jambo Ltd.

## Selected Proofs of Work

### Client Projects

- **Stack AI – Workflow Tutorial Series**  
  Designed standalone tutorials showing the Stack canvas, routing logic, and integrations so teams can clone proven agent workflows.
- **Chatbase – AI Support Education Series**  
  Filmed AI support agent walkthroughs, produced changelog videos for every launch, and kept Mintlify docs in sync.
- **Synthflow – Synthflow Academy Buildout**  
  Scripted and filmed a from-scratch curriculum covering foundational to advanced integrations so 20k+ operators could ship AI agents faster.

### Personal Proof Playbooks

- **Yes Coach – AI Character Platform**  
  Full multi-modal companion studio with React 19 front end, Node/Express API, Firestore, Gemini/Imagen/Veo orchestration, WebSocket voice stack, and Vitest-backed coverage.
- **LUMIER – Luxury AI Grid Studio**  
  Monetized SaaS turning raw product shots into curated Instagram grids via Gemini 3.0 Pro Vision, Node/Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM, Stripe billing, and a luxury “Atelier” UX system.

## Focus & Philosophy

- Explore the frontier, stress-test models, and push them into real workflows.  
- Teach by building in public—no slides, just raw orchestration and debug logs.  
- Keep everything video-first so builders feel the nuance, not just hear about it.  
- Empower anyone to create their own tools with repeatable playbooks and labs.

## Collaborate

I run **AI Tutorial Labs** for startups that need cinematic education engines: scripting, live capture, launch walkthroughs, and reuse-ready docs. Retainer availability is limited (two slots per quarter) and I work remote from Mallorca.
